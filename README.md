# Predictive Gold Trading Research

This repository presents an applied quantitative research project focused on the
design, validation, and diagnostic analysis of a **predictive, risk-aware trading
model for gold**.

The work emphasises **robustness, downside control, and out-of-sample validation**
rather than maximising in-sample performance. Core model logic and signal generation
are intentionally excluded; the focus is on research methodology, optimisation,
and performance diagnostics.

## Research Overview

- Asset: Gold
- Data horizon: ~24 years (2001–2025)
- Validation approach: Walk-forward testing
- Objective: Control downside risk while maintaining strong long-term returns

The research framework integrates:
- Feature-driven predictive modelling
- Regime-aware decision logic
- Multi-stage optimisation
- Systematic validation against common failure modes

All reported results are derived from **fully out-of-sample walk-forward testing**.

## Key Results (Summary)

- Compound annual return: ~29.5% vs ~9.9% for Buy & Hold
- Maximum drawdown: ~-17% vs ~-48% for Buy & Hold
- Stable performance across decades, regimes, and volatility environments
- Rapid drawdown recovery characteristics
- Consistent out-of-sample performance matching or exceeding in-sample results

Full results, charts, and commentary are documented in the research report.
